## _Prologue_

</center>

The train was shaking itself free of London at last and the long-legged, fair-haired, dreamy-eyed boy in the corner seat of a first-class smoking carriage settled himself down with a small sigh. The first stop would be Rugby, and Rugby meant school. He felt glad on the whole that he was beginning a new term; home was a dreary sort of place and these last holidays had been worse than usual. If only his father would simply ignore him, life would be bearable; but that unending fire of criticism and teasing was pretty grim. He could not help being the sort of son for whom his father had absolutely no use. And, after all, why should he try to help it? Why shouldn’t he go his own way? He turned to pick up his paper and glanced, for the first time, at his two travelling companions. They were both very ordinary looking, evidently

business men returning from their holidays, for they were comparing notes. 

“Yes!” said one, “I started off with the idea of a walking tour in Cornwall, but funnily enough, when I reached my first night’s halt—a small town called Launceston—there was something in the place which seemed to grip me, and I stayed there for nearly a week. It is a wonderful old place and full, of course, of historical interest, but it wasn’t that exactly that held me. It was something I can only call an impress of sanctity.” 

The second man laughed. “That’s what comes of being a recent convert,” he said in rather patronizing tones. “At the present moment youre full of devotion, sentiment, what not. You will soon grow out of it. It’s a regular phase, I understand.” 

The first speaker smiled in a deprecating way that the watching boy found attractive. “I expect you're right,” he said. “But whatever may happen in a year or two, it’s all real enough to me now. I stayed at the Crown, bang in the middle of the old town. The place around is simply amazing. There, almost at the door, was the ruin of an old castle, supposed to have been

built by King Arthur. Historically it is older than the Conquest and belonged in the first place to the Kings of Cornwall. Quite close by, in a dungeon of the old prison, the martyr Cuthbert Mayne was imprisoned and he was executed in the market-place. There were heaps of Catholics imprisoned there, for it was nearly as hard to rob the Cornishman of his Faith as it is now to persuade him to return to it. Near my pub there was an old church dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen. Talk about the ages of Faith! You couldn’t look at that church without realizing the existence of a God to be loved. It’s a marvellous piece of work, not one uncarved stone on the whole exterior. A man called Trecarrell, a big gun there in those days, built it in memory of his only son. The market was old too, and down in the valley, between the town and St. Stephen’s, were two water-mills that were both mentioned in Domesday Book. Close to one of them, just behind the gas works, there’s part of the ruin of a Priory of Augustinian Canons; the church is there and some empty vaults, Most of the hill opposite belonged to the Benedictines of Tavistock. Werrington, an estate on the far side, has a curse on it, I was told. St, Stephen’s Church

on the top of the hill, an Early English building, belonged to the Canons at the bottom of the hill. Some extraordinary peasant girl, who married very well in London, built the tower. The whole place seemed somehow steeped in its past; I felt it as soon as I walked in along the road from Polson, before I knew anything about it. And after I had wandered round and round those Priory ruins—I didn’t seem able to get away from them—I could have sworn that I could see the Canons themselves walking about. I often used to turn round when I was going anywhere, thinking that there was someone behind me, and I used to fancy I could catch glimpses, out of the tail of my eye, of people in old-world clothes, though of course when I faced round squarely there was nothing.” 

“You ought to have seen a doctor,” answered the other man, with what seemed to the boy unnecessary offensiveness. “You were suffering from brain fag after learning the guide book by heart.” 

“There you're wrong. When I talked to a Padre I met at an inn in Egloskerry some days later he seemed to understand all about it, He said it was quite reasonable to suppose that places where a great deal of very intense life had been

lived in the past should retain some impress of it. He said, too, that some places gave one the idea that just on that spot the curtain between time and eternity had, so to speak, worn thin. Since there is no time in God, present and future make but one thing in Him, and there are seasons when we feel that the sequence of time has a looser hold on us; such, for instance, as in moments of intense thought. After all, the Laws of Nature are in no way binding on God and, though miracles of all kinds seem wonderful to us, the Master of Nature can do what He likes with His own Laws. No one can lay any restrictions on the means God may use to draw souls. He often uses extraordinary channels of grace when a soul, for some reason outside itself, has been deprived of the ordinary means of grace. . . .” 

The boy in the corner heard no more. The paper had slipped from his knee and he was staring out of the window. Launceston and Egloskerry—where had he heard those names? Yes, he remembered now, his old nurse had told him something about his mother living there before she married, And the curtain between time and eternity was thin just there, was it? Time and eternity? He knew what time was, but eternity?

Perhaps eternity meant that time stood still for ever. How strange if he were to go to Egloskerry and find his mother there, a happy, vivid girl, as his nurse had said she used to be before his father’s loud voice and bullying ways had changed her into a cold, indifferent shadow. If he were really to choose for himself, though, he wished that time had stood still during the fortnight which had preceded his mother’s death, when she had seemed to wake out of an unhappy dream and had begun to show love and interest for her only child.

He remembered one evening, when she had actually come into his bedroom after dinner and bending over him had kissed him, whispering, “God bless my own boy!” If that time had lasted for ever how well they would have got to know one another and how happy life would have been. But then a few days after she had died quite suddenly, leaving him to face a far worse blank than before. If only he could find her again! Where had she gone? Was it just like a candle which was blown out, or was she at Launceston and Egloskerry . . . Launceston and Egloskerry. . . . The fair head was drooping lower and lower, and as he said the last words

it gave such a nod that he woke with a jerk. “First luncheon is served, Sir,” said a steward, looking in at the door, and the boy got slowly to his feet.
